            //To actually be able to display anything with three.js, we need three things: scene, camera and renderer,
            //so that we can render the scene with camera.
            const scene = new THREE.Scene();
            //There are a few different cameras in three.js. For now, let's use a PerspectiveCamera.
            const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
                //The first attribute is the field of view.
                //FOV is the extent of the scene that is seen on the display at any given moment.
                //The value is in degrees.
                75,

                //The second one is the aspect ratio.
                //You almost always want to use the width of the element divided by the height,
                //or you'll get the same result as when you play old movies on a widescreen TV - the image looks squished.
                window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,

                //The next two attributes are the NEAR and FAR clipping plane.
                //What that means, is that
                //objects further away from the camera than the value of FAR
                //or closer than NEAR
                //won't be rendered.
                0.1,
                1000
            );

            //In addition to the WebGLRenderer we use here, three.js comes with a few others,
            //often used as fallbacks for users with older browsers or for those who don't have WebGL support for some reason.
            const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

            //In addition to creating the renderer instance, we also need to set the size at which we want it to render our app.
            //It's a good idea to use the width and height of the area we want to fill with our app -
            //in this case, the width and height of the browser window.
            //For performance intensive apps, you can also give setSize smaller values,
            //like window.innerWidth/2 and window.innerHeight/2, which will make the app render at quarter size.
            renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

            //If you wish to keep the size of your app but render it at a lower resolution, you can do so by calling setSize with false as updateStyle (the third argument). For example, setSize(window.innerWidth/2, window.innerHeight/2, false) will render your app at half resolution, given that your <canvas> has 100% width and height.

            //Last but not least, we add the renderer element to our HTML document.
            //This is a <canvas> element the renderer uses to display the scene to us.
            document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

            //BoxGeometry is an object that contains all the points (vertices) and fill (faces) of the cube.
            const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();

            //we need a material to color it. We'll stick to the MeshBasicMaterial for now.
            //All materials take an object of properties which will be applied to them.
            const material = new THREE.MeshMatcapMaterial({ color: 0xefdbd3 });

            //The third thing we need is a Mesh.
            //A mesh is an object that takes a geometry, and applies a material to it,
            //which we then can insert to our scene, and move freely around.
            const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

            //By default, when we call scene.add(), the thing we add will be added to the coordinates (0,0,0).
            //This would cause both the camera and the cube to be inside each other.
            scene.add(cube);
            //To avoid this, we simply move the camera out a bit.
            camera.position.z = 5;

            //We're not actually rendering anything yet. For that, we need what's called a render or animate loop.
            //This will create a loop that causes the renderer to draw the scene every time the screen is refreshed
            //(on a typical screen this means 60 times per second).
            function animate() {
                //requestAnimationFrame has a number of advantages.
                //Perhaps the most important one is that it pauses when the user navigates to another browser tab.
                requestAnimationFrame(animate);

                //This will be run every frame (normally 60 times per second), and give the cube a nice rotation animation. 
                //Basically, anything you want to move or change while the app is running has to go through the animate loop. 
                //You can of course call other functions from there, so that you don't end up with an animate function 
                //that's hundreds of lines.
                cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
                cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
                renderer.render(scene, camera);
            }
